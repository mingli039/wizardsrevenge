				<span class="objective_discription">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					You're a wizard, and you are back for revenge. The Xiang Qi Emperor sent his soldiers to destroy your family and other fellow wizards, and they have succeeded. You are the last wizard, and it's your job to avenge your family. You must go and break through Xiang Qi's imperial defenses, then you'll be able to go and defeat Xiang Qi, good luck!

				<span class="objective">How To Play:</span>
				<span class="objective_discription">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Press the arrow keys to move around. To use your sword, hold down space bar. To beat the level, get to the black exit at the other side of the room, but be careful, Xiang Qi has his place crawling all over with his imperial forces, they'll drain your health in less then a second. To add on to that, they get stronger every level. Sometimes drastically. It's important to knock out his imperial forces because you will then gain experience, which will help you climb up the ranks. The Higher the rank you are, the more your health, attack and speed stats will blossom.  Be sure to collect items, most items are found when defeating enemies. Items will also give you health, attack boosts, and speed boosts. If you lose all your health however you'll have to restart all the way from level one! I hope you proceed to defeating Xiang Qi!
